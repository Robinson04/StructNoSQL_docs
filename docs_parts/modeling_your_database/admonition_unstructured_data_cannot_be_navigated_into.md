:::info Unstructured data cannot be navigated into
Even if you define the item type of your list to be a ```dict``` or ```list```, since it is unstructured, you will not
be able to navigate into or select specific attributes to retrieve/update/delete inside your list items like you
can do with a structured list field as shown above. You will only be able to target the entire dict or list value.
