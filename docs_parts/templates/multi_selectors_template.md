No matter what, ```{{variable_name}}``` will always be a dictionary containing as keys all the names of the 
fields you {{attempted_operation_explanation}}. 
Even if the operation failed, the dictionary will be returned with a ```{{default_value}}``` value for each 
{{individual_target_type_name}}.
You can safely access the fields values with brackets instead of using the ```.get``` function on your dictionary.
