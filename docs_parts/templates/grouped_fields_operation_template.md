You can use {{operation_link}} to {{alteration_type}} multiple fields from different places{{additional}}.
Like ```{{type_operation_single}}```, you select by its primary key value the record you want to {{alteration_type}} 
fields from, with the ```key_value``` parameter.
Specify the different fields you want to {{alteration_type}} by passing a dictionary of {{object_link}}.
Similarly to ```{{type_operation_single}}```, each {{object_link}} requires the field_path parameter, and has an 
optional query_kwargs parameter.
